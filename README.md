## First step : login

## Second step : lobby

Since you've joined the lobby you have three choices :
* Join a room
* Create your own
* Wait, as the lobby is real-time sync, there is no need for refreshing !

## Third step : game (before)

No difference between the creator of the room and the others who joined,
Just wait the game to start and observe who will play with you.
